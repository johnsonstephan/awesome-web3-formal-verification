To learn more about how to contribute to a project through forking, follow [these steps](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).

If it's your first time contributing, check out [this tutorial](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).

## New Resources

For new resources, submit a resource by submitting a pull request with your suggested resource. Ensure to match the format of the other resources.

## Existing Resources

For the existing resources, you may:

- **Fix Typos / Broken Links**: Make your changes and submit a PR. You may also raise in the discussions. Include your reasoning for why the addition is valuable.
- **Remove (Outdated) Resources**: Share your suggestion in a PR or raise in discussions with your reasoning.

**Note:** Our shared goal is not to have the longest list of items. Our goal is to maintain a list of the most relevant resources for today.

## Discussions

Use the [Discussions section](https://github.com/johnsonstephan/Awesome-Web3-Formal-Verification/discussions) to talk about all sorts of topics related to this resource. For example: if you'd like help troubleshooting a PR, have a great new idea for how to improve this, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in the discussions.

## Guidelines

- <p><strong>The goal is to showcase the most relevant and useful resources.</strong><br />
  Adding every possible resource out there is not our goal. Imagine you are learning about formal verification in Web3 today, what would you ingest? Use your judgement to filter out the non-essential material.  </p>
- <p><strong>Only add resources that you have personally evaluated</strong><br />
  Have you read that article? Did you complete this tutorial? Was the resource personally valuable to you? 
  Honestly assess if this resource will also be valuable to the community.</p>
- <p><strong>PR Submissions</strong></p>
  If you are planning to contribute by adding resources, I recommend you to: (a) write meaningful commit messages and (b) look at the existing pull requests (and open discussions) before opening new ones.
